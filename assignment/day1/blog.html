            <p>Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds: to create a new free
                operating system kernel. The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its
                history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C
                files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than
                23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments, under the GNU General Public License v2.</p>

            <p>In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about operating systems.
                Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited it to educational use only, he began to
                work on his own operating system kernel, which eventually became the Linux kernel.Torvalds began the
                development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux.
                Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux systems.GNU applications
                also replaced all MINIX components, because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from
                the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in
                other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license.
                Torvalds initiated a switch from his originallicense, which prohibited commercial redistribution, to the
                AGNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional
                and free operating system.</p>

            The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs, in the United States
            by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was
            written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering
            approach, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some
            hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its
            porting to different computer platforms easier.
            Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T was required to
            license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a result, Unix grew quickly and became
            widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of
            the legal obligation requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where
            users were not legally allowed to modify Unix.<p>

                Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention "Freax", a portmanteau of "free", "freak", and "x" (as
                an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, some of the project's makefiles
                included the name "Freax" for about half a year. Initially, Torvalds considered the name "Linux" but
                dismissed it as too egotistical. To facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server
                (ftp.funet.fi) of FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke, Torvalds' coworker at the Helsinki University of
                Technology (HUT) who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not
                think that "Freax" was a good name, so he named the project "Linux" on the server without consulting
                Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to "Linux".
